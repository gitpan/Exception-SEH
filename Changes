		- rewritten parser for catch/finally
		- parser does not call exit() any more
		- parser error handling differs from 0.01,
			now all parse errors are printed to STDERR and follows some perl message
			this also affect string evals - sometime they get only perl message
			and sometime a correct one
		- speedup of many-catches code
		- more effort is taken to catch errors inside 'catch' correctly
